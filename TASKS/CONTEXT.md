# Context

> Long-term project facts. One-liners only.
>
> **Your responsibilities:**
> - If this file is empty or outdated — **populate it** with what you know from the project
> - If you discover a new lasting fact — **add it**
> - If you notice a contradiction (e.g. it says SQLite but the project now uses PostgreSQL) — **investigate and update** the line, don't append a duplicate
> - Each fact should appear exactly once. When something changes, replace the old line.

<!-- Example:
- Uses PostgreSQL database
- BTC payments via Breez SDK
- Deployed on Vercel
- Main repo: github.com/org/project
