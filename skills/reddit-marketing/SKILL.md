# Reddit Marketing Skill

Authentic community engagement and marketing on Reddit without getting banned.

## When to Use

- Building karma before app launches
- Engaging with target communities
- Researching pain points and language
- Soft promotion through helpful participation

## Core Philosophy

Reddit hates self-promotion. Success requires:
1. **Be genuinely helpful first** — 9 helpful posts before 1 promo
2. **Sound human** — AI-generated content gets flagged and removed
3. **Respect community rules** — Each subreddit is different
4. **Build reputation over time** — Weeks/months, not days

---

## 🚨 ANTI-AI DETECTION (CRITICAL!)

Moderators actively detect AI content. These rules are **mandatory**.

### ❌ NEVER USE (instant AI flags):

| Pattern | Why It's Bad | Use Instead |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| **Em-dash (—)** | #1 AI tell | Comma, period, or hyphen (-) |
| Semicolons (;) | Nobody uses casually | Period or comma |
| "First off" / "That said" | Classic AI opener | Just start talking |
| "It's worth noting" | AI filler phrase | Drop it entirely |
| "I'd recommend" | Formal AI tone | "try X" or "X worked for me" |
| Perfect punctuation | Too polished | Skip some punctuation... |
| Structured responses | Intro→points→conclusion | Just answer naturally |

### ✅ DO USE (sound human):

- Casual tone, incomplete sentences ok
- Contractions: gonna, wanna, kinda, tbh, ngl, imo
- Start with "And" / "But" / "So"
- Small typos ok: dont, youre, its
- Be imperfect — real humans aren't polished
- Personal anecdotes when relevant

### Examples:

❌ **AI-sounding:**
> "First off — huge respect for taking this step. It's worth noting that consistency is key. I'd recommend starting with small, achievable goals."

✅ **Human-sounding:**
> "Huge respect for taking this seriously. Thats already half the battle tbh. Start small - dont try to change everything at once or youll burn out"

**Before posting:** Re-read and remove any em-dashes or overly polished language!

## Marketing Tactics

### The 9:1 Rule

For every 1 promotional post, make 9 genuinely helpful posts first.

```
Weeks 1-3: Only helpful comments, build karma
Week 4+: Occasional soft mentions IF genuinely relevant
```

### The "Question → Discovery" Pattern

1. Find threads where someone asks for app recommendations
2. If your app genuinely solves their problem, mention it
3. Be honest: "I built this" or "found this recently"
4. Don't astroturf (fake accounts, fake questions)

### Safe Promotion Subreddits

These explicitly allow self-promotion:

| Subreddit | Rules |
|-----------|-------|
| r/SideProject | Devs sharing projects |
| r/shamelessplug | Self-promo allowed |
| r/iOSProgramming | Show off iOS apps |
| r/androidapps | [DEV] tag for developers |
| r/TestMyApp | Beta testing requests |
| r/alphaandbetausers | Early user recruitment |
| r/AppHookup | Deals and promos |

### Story Format (Works Well)

> "I was frustrated with [problem] so I built [solution]. Here's what I learned..."

Genuine stories with lessons get upvotes. Pure "check out my app" gets downvoted.

---

## Subreddit Research

Before posting in any subreddit, research:

1. **Rules** — Read sidebar, wiki, pinned posts
2. **Self-promo policy** — Some have "dev" flair, some ban all promotion
3. **Tone** — Casual vs serious, memes vs discussion
4. **Active times** — When do posts get engagement?
5. **Pain points** — What do people complain about?

### Research Template

```markdown
## r/[subreddit]

**Members:** [count]
**Tone:** [casual/serious/meme-heavy]
**Self-promo:** [allowed/banned/dev-flair]
**Best post times:** [timezone, day of week]
**Common pain points:**
- [pain point 1]
- [pain point 2]
**Relevant apps:** [which of our apps fit here]
```

---

## Session Workflow

### 1. Check Notifications First (Every Session!)

Before posting anything new, check outcomes of previous comments:

1. Go to `reddit.com/message/inbox/`
2. Look for:
   - ✅ Replies to your comments (engagement!)
   - ✅ Upvote notifications
   - ❌ Removed/warned comments (learn why)
3. Update your learnings log with outcomes

### 2. Reply to Replies (Build Relationships!)

When checking notifications, look for reply-worthy opportunities:

**Reply when:**
- ✅ Someone asks a follow-up question
- ✅ Someone shares their experience (natural to respond)
- ✅ Someone thanks you (brief encouragement)
- ✅ Good-faith disagreement worth engaging
- ✅ Opportunity to add extra value

**DON'T reply when:**
- ❌ It would seem forced or needy
- ❌ Just to say "thanks!" with nothing else
- ❌ Every single reply (pick 1-2 best ones)
- ❌ Hostile/trolling comments (ignore)

**Goal:** Natural conversation, not obsessive engagement. 1-2 thoughtful replies per session max.

### 3. Then Post New Comments

---

## Posting Workflow

### Pre-Post Checklist

- [ ] Is thread < 24 hours old? (older = less engagement)
- [ ] Have I already commented on this thread? (check history!)
- [ ] Does my comment genuinely help?
- [ ] Re-read for em-dashes and AI patterns
- [ ] Does it match the sub's tone?

### Avoid Duplicate Comments

**Before commenting on ANY thread, check if you've already commented:**

1. Check your activity log / session history
2. If thread URL appears in recent sessions → **SKIP IT**, find different thread
3. Reddit will show "you've already replied" but catching it early saves time

**The flow:** Check history → Find fresh thread → Verify not already commented → Post

### Posting Cadence

- **Space posts:** 10-30 min apart (not rapid-fire)
- **Different subs:** Spread across communities
- **Quality > quantity:** 3 good comments > 10 mediocre ones

### After Posting

Log all activity:
```
| Date | Subreddit | Thread | Type | Outcome |
|------|-----------|--------|------|---------|
| 2026-02-12 | r/loseit | "How do you..." | Helpful comment | +15 upvotes |
```

Check back 24-48h later for:
- Replies (engage if appropriate)
- Upvotes/downvotes (learn what works)
- Mod actions (removed? why?)

---

## Community Mapping

For each app, maintain a list of target communities:

```markdown
## [App Name] — Target Communities

### Primary (direct fit)
- r/[sub1] — [why relevant]
- r/[sub2] — [why relevant]

### Secondary (adjacent)
- r/[sub3] — [angle to use]

### Avoid
- r/[sub4] — [why: strict rules, wrong audience, etc.]
```

---

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It Fails | Do Instead |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| Posting same comment everywhere | Looks like spam, mods notice | Customize per thread |
| Promoting too early | No karma = auto-removed | Build karma first |
| Ignoring subreddit rules | Instant ban | Read rules every time |
| Being defensive about criticism | Looks bad, gets downvoted | Thank them, improve |
| Deleting downvoted posts | Looks suspicious | Leave them, learn |
| Using multiple accounts | Against Reddit TOS, ban risk | One authentic account |

---

## Tracking Success

### Metrics to Track

- **Karma growth** — Are helpful posts getting upvoted?
- **Comment replies** — Are people engaging?
- **Mod actions** — Any removals/warnings?
- **Traffic** — (Post-launch) referrals from Reddit?

### Learning Log

Keep a learnings file:

```markdown
## What Works
- [Tactic] in r/[sub] got [result]

## What Doesn't Work
- [Tactic] in r/[sub] got [result]

## Subreddit-Specific Rules
- r/ADHD bans "neurodivergent" terminology
- r/loseit mods detect AI content aggressively
```

---

## Timeline for New App

| Week | Focus |
|------|-------|
| 1-2 | Research subreddits, understand communities |
| 3-4 | Start helpful commenting, build karma |
| 5-6 | Continue helping, note pain points for marketing |
| 7-8 | Soft mentions if genuinely relevant |
| Launch | Post in promo-allowed subs, story format in others |
| Post-launch | Continue engaging, respond to feedback |

---

## Persistence Rule (Don't Give Up!)

Browser issues and Reddit quirks will happen. **Try at least 3 times before giving up on posting.**

```
Attempt 1: Navigate → Snapshot → Try to post
  Failed? → Wait 5 sec → Fresh snapshot → Try again
Attempt 2: Same flow
  Failed? → Wait 5 sec → Fresh snapshot → Try again  
Attempt 3: Same flow
  Failed? → NOW you can try a different thread
```

**If one thread fails, try a DIFFERENT thread** — don't just give up on posting entirely.

**Only switch to research-only mode if:**
- 3+ different threads all failed
- Rate limited by Reddit (not browser issues)
- Actually out of time

---

## Browser Automation (Detailed)

If using OpenClaw browser for Reddit:

### Core Rules

1. **Reddit's JS is heavy** — elements go stale within seconds
2. **Always re-snapshot** before each action
3. **Pattern:** Snapshot → Act → Snapshot → Act (never chain actions)
4. **Close tabs when done** — don't leave them open
5. **Rate limits:** New accounts limited to ~1 comment/10 min

### Step-by-Step Posting Flow

```
1. Navigate to thread URL
2. Take snapshot (get fresh refs)
3. Wait 2-3 seconds (let JS settle)
4. Take another snapshot (refs may have changed!)
5. Find comment box in NEW snapshot
6. Click to focus → type → submit
```

### Common Issues & Fixes

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| "Element ref not found" | Stale ref from old snapshot | Re-snapshot before every action |
| Comment box won't focus | Need to click placeholder first | Click "Add a comment" text, then type |
| Post button doesn't work | Wrong button (multiple exist) | Use button inside comment editor |
| Rate limited | Reddit limits new accounts | Switch to research, try next session |
| Page won't load | Reddit's servers slow | Wait, retry, or try different sub |

### Browser Action Pattern

```
browser action=snapshot  → get current state
browser action=act request={kind:"click", ref:"[comment-box-ref]"}
browser action=snapshot  → verify focus worked
browser action=act request={kind:"type", ref:"[textarea-ref]", text:"your comment"}
browser action=snapshot  → verify text appeared
browser action=act request={kind:"click", ref:"[submit-button-ref]"}
```

**Key rule:** Snapshot → Act → Snapshot → Act. Never chain actions without fresh snapshots.

### Clean Up After Yourself

**Don't leave tabs open!** They stack up and consume memory.

After finishing with a thread, close the tab. Before ending your session, close any tabs you opened.
